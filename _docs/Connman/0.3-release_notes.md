### ConnMan 1.34 released April 27th, 2017.

`ConnMan 1.34` now supports `nftables` in addtion to `iptables` with `nftables` being selectable at build time. Also initial support for IWD WiFi daemon is in place, and thus the new daemon can be taken out for a test drive. Configurability has been improved, technologies can now be marked as always connected and the online check can be disabled. Also to note is that the provided systemd service file no longer contains CAP_KILL capability should some non-upstream configuration use fork and exec from within ConnMan.

Users should consider upgrading, as version 1.34 also contains a long list of enhancements and bugfixes:

 * Use `adjtimex` to tune time received by `NTP` (Justin Maggard)

 * Avoid potential endless loop in Bluetooth on connection failure (Frédéric Dalleau) and check for a network in the plugin callbacks (Patrik Flykt)
 * Add support for `nftables` to set `NAT` and other firewall rules and create a set of APIs that use either `iptables` or `nftables` (Daniel Wagner)
 * Ensure callbacks are called also for `WPS` WiFi networks (Jose Blanquicet)
 * Propagate WiFi disconnect reason from the plugin to service handling (Daniel Wagner)
 * Prevent WiFi scanning attempts on tethering interfaces and P2P finding on powered down interfaces (Jose Blanquicet) and fix NAT issues (Lukasz Nowak)
 * Initial support for `IWD` WiFi plugin (Daniel Wagner)
 * Add support for technologies that should always be connected (Ioan-Adrian Ratiu)
 * Add support for enabling or disabling online check (Lukasz Nowak)

 * Support `openvpn` netmask (Michele Dionisio) and logging (Daniel Wagner)
 * Clear up excess debug printing (Daniel Wagner)
 * Drop CAP_KILL from the provided systemd service file as ConnMan does not fork and exec any processes (Patrik Flykt)
 * Reset offset to zero before writing to variables in `/proc/` (Daniel Wagner)
 * Add allowed interfaces for sessions (Daniel Wagner) and support multi-interface routing (Lukasz Nowak)

Thanks for the hard work and bugfixes go to Feng Wang, Harish Jenny K N, Jose Blanquicet, Luiz Augusto von Dentz, Marcel Holtmann, Naveen Singh, Patrik Flykt, Saurav Babu, Google, Intel, Magneti Marelli, Nest Labs and Samsung.

### Connman 1.32 released April 18th, 2016.

This release of ConnMan removes support for `Bluez 4.x`, which saw its last upstream release 3½ years ago. `Bluez 5` has been supported since with ConnMan version 1.11 for a bit over three years now with all distributions providing `Bluez 5` for a long time already.

With version 1.32 being mostly a bug fix release, issues fixed include:

 * Support `tun` and `tap` devices for `VPNs `(Hendrik Donner)
 * Support for `iptables 1.6` (Wu Zheng)
 * Support for displaying Clock API settings in `connmanctl` (Saurav Babu)
 * Interfaces starting with ve- and vb- created by systemd have been added to the default interface blacklist (Krisztian Litkey)
 * Fix `DHCP` issues with renewal of nameservers  (Naveen Singh), timeservers, MTU (Patrik Flykt), timer removal and sending Discover after obtaining link-local address (Saurav Babu)
 * Re-enable fallback nameservers when the service changes to one with no nameservers specified (Patrik Flykt)
 * Properly remove `P2P` peers when disabling `P2P` technology (John Ernberg)
 * Prevent `wpa_supplicant` memory leak by calling RemoveNetwork when the WiFi network deauthenticates `ConnMan` (Naveen Singh)
 * Restore previous ip_forward value in /proc when tethering is disabled (Patrik Flykt) and allow raw PSK key when tethering via WiFi (Jose Blanquicet)
 * Build-time detection of execinfo.h needed for optional or no backtrace implementation in uClibc and musl (Yann Morin)
 * Simplification of gateway selection (Patrik Flykt)

Thanks for all the hard work and bugfixes go to Hendrik Donner, John Ernberg, Jose Blanquicet, Krisztian Litkey, Marcel Holtmann, Milind Ramesh Murhekar, Naveen Singh, Niraj Kumar Goit, Nishant Chaprana, Patrik Flykt, Ravi Prasad RK, Saurav Babu, Slava Monich, Wu Zheng, Yann Morin, Intel, Jolla, Magneti Marelli, Nest and Samsung.

### ConnMan 1.31 released December 28, 2015.

Thanks to Mylène Josserand, `ConnMan 1.31` now properly exposes multiple cellular contexts provided by oFono whenever supported by the cellular subscription. In addition, ConnMan now writes its resolv.conf file to `[/var]/run/connmand` with the provided `tmpfiles.d` and init script creating the run-time directory and a symlink from `/etc/resolv.conf`. If the run time directory does not exist, ConnMan falls back to modifying `/etc/resolv.conf` as before.

With this release ConnMan also improves on systemd support. ConnMan now provides connmand-wait-online which works exactly as its counterpart systemd-networkd-wait-online. By default connmand-wait-online waits until a service enters 'ready' state before reaching network-online.target. In addition, capabilities not needed are removed and with the resolv.conf handling improvements filesystems are mounted read-only with access to /home and /run/user denied in the ConnMan systemd .service file.

After difficulties with the mailing list, the list has been re-enabled and is now up and running at its new address connman@lists.01.org.

The by now very ancient `Bluez 4.x` support will be removed with the next ConnMan release. `Bluez 4.x` has been superseded by 5.x a long time ago with a generous upgrade time window for ConnMan users. With no new `Bluez 4.x` releases for years, we do not want to have dependencies on no longer supported versions.

Other improvements and bug fixes include:

 * Correctly enumerate `Distributed Switch Architecture` (DSA) interfaces (Laurent Vaudoit)
 * Fix documentation and implementation of `ClearProperty` D-Bus method call (Naveen Singh, Patrik Flykt)
 * Update and create missing man pages (Jaakko Hannikainen)
 * Try to re-use the same IP subnet as previously used for tethering (Patrik Flykt)
 * Implement `IPv6` timeserver support (Naveen Singh)
 * Improved `DNS search domain` handling (Pasi Sjöholm)
 * Fixes for `DNS proxy` (Frank Stevers), gsupplicant (Maneesh Jain), `VPN` parameters (Jaakko Hannikainen), accidental disabling of IPv6 on all interfaces (Abtin Keshavarzian), typedefs for strict compilers (Grant Erickson), potential crash with Bluetooth (Harish Jenny K N), memory leaks (Saurav Babu, Slava Monich), gdhcp and agent issues (Michael Olbrich)

Thanks for all the hard work and bugfixes go to Abtin Keshavarzian, Frank Stevers, Grant Erickson, Harish Jenny K N, Jaakko Hannikainen, Jakub Pawlowski, Johan Hedberg, Laurent Vaudoit, Maneesh Jain, Marcel Holtmann, Marcus Folkesson, Michael Olbrich, Myléne Josserand, Naveen Singh, Pasi Sjöholm, Patrik Flykt, Philip Withnall, Saurav Babu, Slava Monich, Collabora, Intel, Jolla, Nest and Samsung.

### GNOME shell extension for ConnMan
![GNOME shell extension for ConnMan](images/screenshot_gnome_extension.png)

During the last months a new GNOME shell extension for ConnMan has been created by Jaakko Hannikainen that supports GNOME starting from version 3.14. The extension is uploaded to [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/981/connman-extension/) with its [upstream repository on github](https://github.com/jgke/gnome-extension-connman). Also, a stand-alone ConnMan settings application has been created, supporting GNOME from version 3.10 onwards. The settings application is [available on github](https://github.com/jgke/connman-gtk).

Its also possible to run the [system tray based UI](https://github.com/tbursztyka/connman-ui) on GNOME; the system tray works on any modern desktop implementing the freedesktop.org standard. The system tray based UI was created by Tomasz Bursztyka.

In addition to these UIs, Arch linux has an excellent [list of ConnMan UIs](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Connman).

### ConnMan 1.30 released August 31st, 2015.

`ConnMan 1.30` contains a long list of improvements and bug fixes applied since last release. One notable user visible feature is the deprecation of 6to4 tunneling, it no longer is enabled by default for global IPv4 addresses as recommended by RFC 6343. This was noticed and implemented by Tore Andersson, a big thanks to him for following the latest RFCs and implementing the recommendation in ConnMan.

The improvements and bug fixes include:

 * WiFi enhancements that track Access Point enabling (Bing Niu) and enabling tethering first for unused WiFi devices (Patrik Flykt)
 * Fixes for WiFi handling in case of failure with 4-way handshake, state change (Pasi Sjöholm), WPS (Yusuke Nakamura), provisioning (Peter Meerwald), P2P (Michael Olbrich), memory leaks etc. (Maneesh Jain, Harish Jenny K N), in addition to adding support for anonymous identity (Jaakko Hannikainen)
 * Improve `DNS` server handling (Jukka Rissanen, Patrik Flykt)
 * Fix issues with `DHCP` (Saurav Babu, Peter Meerwald)
 * Several internal improvements related to IP configuration information handling (Patrik Flykt, Pasi Sjöholm)
 * Fix building with `automake` dependency tracking disabled (Ross Burton)
 * Fix `systemd` service dependencies (Patrik Flykt)
 * Internal improvements and fixes for service and provisioning file handling (Patrik Flykt), D-Bus attribute parsing (Jaakko Hannikainen) and Agent API SSID parsing (Adam Moore)
 * connmanctl command line client now supports all Service API methods (Saurav Babu) with memory leaks being fixed and VPN connections autocompleted (Jaakko Hannikainen)
 * Several fixes to the `VPN` daemon (Jukka Rissanen)
 * Session policy routing now uses SNAT in order to do a proper re-routing decision (Daniel Wagner)

Thanks for all the hard work and bugfixes go to Adam Moore, Bing Niu, Daniel Wagner, Harish Jenny K N, Jaakko Hannikainen, Jukka Rissanen, Maneesh Jain, Marcel Holtmann, Marcin Niestrój, Marko Sulejic, Michael Olbrich, Pasi Sjöholm, Patrik Flykt, Peter Meerwald, Ross Burton, Saurav Babu, Slava Monich, Thiemo van Engelen, Tore Anderson, Yusuke Nakamura, BMW, Intel, Jolla, Samsung and Victron Energy.

### ConnMan 1.29 released April 20th, 2015.

With version 1.29 ConnMan now shows Virtual LANs with the ethernet technology. VLAN configuration needs to happen outside ConnMan, and the VLANs follow ethernet Powered and Tethering settings in the Technology API. A big thanks for Marcus Folkesson and Justin Maggard for stepping forward with the implementation.

Other improvements in this release includes:

 * Ethernet services will now be properly connected when a cable is plugged in exactly as documented for the Service API. Every ethernet interface with a cable attached will therefore show up as a connected ethernet service (Patrik Flykt).
 * Several issues with DHCPv6 fixed, especially with DHCPv6 servers expecting the client to always accept packets on the DHCPV6 client port (Pasi Sjöholm, Jukka Rissanen)
 * WiFi passwords are now properly handled and WiFi networks with identical SSIDs to known ones will not cause the passphrase to be removed due to errors (Patrik Flykt)
 * Hidden WiFi networks no longer use the last known frequency so that wpa_supplicant is able to find them should they have moved to a different channel (Jukka Rissanen)
 * Fixes for systemd startup files (Andreas Oberritter)

Thanks for all the hard work and bugfixes to Andreas Oberritter, Arman Uguray, Chris Hiszpanski, Jukka Rissanen, Justin Maggard, Luiz Augusto von Dentz, Marcel Holtmann, Marcus Folkesson, Michael Janssen, Pasi Sjöholm, Patrik Flykt, Philip Withnall, Slava Monich, Szymon Janc, Tomáš Čech, Vinicius Costa Gomes, Intel and Jolla.

### ConnMan 1.28 released February 1st, 2015.

Upgrading ConnMan is strongly encouraged as this release fixes an issue with `DHCPv6` retransmission timer calculation that causes system load to jump to 100%. In addition, all WiFi P2P issues encountered with Miracast have been addressed thanks to persistent reporting and fixing by Jussi Kukkonen, Tomasz Bursztyka and Jukka Rissanen.

ConnMan no longer hands off foreground autoscanning to wpa_supplicant as it causes issues when finding hidden WiFi networks. As a result, the previously recommended build time option has be removed from the documentation. wpa_supplicant can still be built with autoscan enabled but as ConnMan no longer enables it run time the issue is mitigated.

Other changes and fixes include:

 * Several fixes for handling IPv6 contexts via `oFono` (Pasi Sjöholm)
 * Fix memory deallocation in exit code paths (Hannu Mallat)
 * Use `OPEN auth_alg` for `wpa_supplicant` open WiFi networks (Slava Monich)
 * A WiFi Access Point with unknown strength now has a proper minimum value which translates to a service 'Strength' property of 30 (Patrik Flykt)
 * Fix byte order in DHCP server identifier (Jukka Rissanen)
 * Properly cancel an ongoing service connect if the Agent exits (Patrik Flykt)

Thanks for all the hard work and bugfixes go to David Lechner, Hannu Mallat, Jason Abele, Jukka Rissanen, Marcel Holtmann, Pasi Sjöholm, Patrik Flykt, Slava Monich, Tomasz Bursztyka, Aether, Intel and Jolla.

### ConnMan 1.27 released December 13th, 2014.

Thanks to code contributed by David Lechner, ConnMan can now use Bluetooth `GN` and `PANU` profiles in addition to the already supported NAP one when creating services. Should the Bluetooth device expose more than one of these profiles, only one service is created per device with the order of preference being NAP, GN and PANU. Tethering via Bluetooth has not been changed, Bluetooth NAP continues to be the single IP connectivity profile presented to tethered devices.

The rest of the relase consists of bugfixes, with the most notable one being WiFi scanning fixes by Jason Abele.

Thanks for all the hard work and bugfixing go to Chengyi Zhao, David Lechner, Erik Larsson, Hannu Mallat, Jason Abele, Marcel Holtmann, Patrik Flykt, Slava Monich, Tomasz Bursztyka, Intel and Jolla.

### ConnMan 1.26 released October 12th, 2014.

`WiFi P2P` support in ConnMan has been significantly improved also in this release by Tomasz Bursztyka and Eduardo Abinader. Applications can now register WiFi Display, UPnP or Bonjour P2P services, which ConnMan makes available to other P2P devices. Acting as a WiFi P2P Group Owner is enabled when needed. In addition, ConnMan will now properly select the WPS push button method when handling incoming connections and authorizes them via the Agent API RequestPeerAuthorization() method call. The primary P2P device type is selected based on systemd-hostnamed device type. As before, wpa_supplicant from upstream git is needed to get all necessary WiFi P2P functionality working.

Other changes visible to users include:

 * DHCPv6 Confirm messages are not supported anymore, as the the address expiration lifetimes are not easily available (Jukka Rissanen). Bugs with DHCPv6 and DHCPv4 have been fixed in addition to IP address and network handling (Jukka Rissanen, Pasi Sjöholm, Peter Meerwald)
 * Interface IPv6 privacy setting is properly set to its intended value when removing a service (Pasi Sjöholm)
 * Add WiFi security type to provisioning files (Patrik Flykt)
 * A service failure state is no longer saved to or loaded from persistent storage (Patrik Flykt)

Thanks for all the hard work and bugfixing goes to Alban Crequy, Andrei Emeltchenko, Claudio Takahasi, Eduardo Abinader, Hannu Mallat, Jukka Rissanen, Jussi Kukkonen, Luiz Augusto von Dentz, Marcel Holtmann, Pasi Sjöholm, Patrik Flykt, Peter Meerwald, Tomasz Bursztyka, Collabora, Intel, Jolla and OpenBossa.
