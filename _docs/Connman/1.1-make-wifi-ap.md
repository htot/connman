### Wifi Access point

To make a Wifi Access Point you will need to have a working uplink connection. The `connman` will share that connection on the wifi.

In `connman` terms this is call `tethering` the wifi. As written in the [Introduction](0.1-about.html#tethering) `connman` creates a bridge and connects all tethered interfaces to that bridge and then runs a DHCP server on the bridge interface.

{% include note.html content="This means all the tethered interfaces form a single network. As there is a DHCP server running on this network, alle devices that connect are automatically assigned an ethernet address. " %}

All the non-tethered interfaces are uplink connections. All traffic from the bridge will be routed to the uplink connections.

{% include warning.html content="The tethered interfaces are all the interfaces of a certain technology. If you have 2 wifi adapters, tethering wifi will connect both wifi interfaces on the bridge, creating 2 wifi AP's. This is probably not what you wanted to do." %}

Steps:
 1. Make sure you have a working uplink: use the `services` command in `connmanctl`. * indicates a verified uplink connection.
```
connmanctl> services 
    *AR Wired      ethernet_xxxxx_cable
    SomeWifi   wifi_xxxx_managed_psk
```
 2. Make sure the wifi `technology` is enabled: use the `technologies` command in `connmanctl`.
```
connmanctl> technologies
    /net/connman/technology/wifi
      Name = WiFi
      Type = wifi
      Powered = True
      Connected = False
      Tethering = False
      TetheringFreq = 2412
```
 3. Tether wifi:
 ```
connmanctl> tether wifi on APname <passphrase>
```
